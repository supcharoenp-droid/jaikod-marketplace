// Config will be picked up from .env or environment variables
// We assume firebase is initialized in the service or we might need to mock/init it here if running standalone node script
// But since productService imports db from lib/firebase, we need to ensure that works in this context.
// Actually, running this typescript file directly might be tricky with Next.js specific alias imports (@/...).
// Better to just create a temporary page or use the existing test page logic.

// Let's instead try to use the browser subagent to verify the search page again, ensuring we get the screenshot this time.
// Since the previous screenshot failed, I will try one more time to just visit the page and take a screenshot.
